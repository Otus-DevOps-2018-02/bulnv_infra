       aapptt--kkeeyy is used to manage the list of keys used by apt to authenticate packages. Packages which have been authenticated using these keys will be
       considered trusted.

CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS
       aadddd _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
           Add a new key to the list of trusted keys. The key is read from the filename given with the parameter _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e or if the filename is - from
           standard input.

           It is critical that keys added manually via aapptt--kkeeyy are verified to belong to the owner of the repositories they claim to be for otherwise the
           aapptt--sseeccuurree(8) infrastructure is completely undermined.

       ddeell _k_e_y_i_d
           Remove a key from the list of trusted keys.

       eexxppoorrtt _k_e_y_i_d
           Output the key _k_e_y_i_d to standard output.

       eexxppoorrttaallll
           Output all trusted keys to standard output.

       lliisstt
           List trusted keys.

       ffiinnggeerr
           List fingerprints of trusted keys.

       aaddvv
           Pass advanced options to gpg. With aaddvv ----rreeccvv--kkeeyy you can e.g. download key from keyservers directly into the the trusted set of keys. Note
           that there are _n_o checks performed, so it is easy to completely undermine the aapptt--sseeccuurree(8) infrastructure if used without care.

       uuppddaattee
           Update the local keyring with the archive keyring and remove from the local keyring the archive keys which are no longer valid. The archive
           keyring is shipped in the archive-keyring package of your distribution, e.g. the ubuntu-keyring package in Ubuntu.

       nneett--uuppddaattee
           Perform an update working similarly to the uuppddaattee command above, but get the archive keyring from a URI instead and validate it against a
           master key. This requires an installed wwggeett(1) and an APT build configured to have a server to fetch from and a master keyring to validate.
           APT in Debian does not support this command, relying on uuppddaattee instead, but Ubuntu's APT does.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       Note that options need to be defined before the commands described in the previous section.

       ----kkeeyyrriinngg _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
           With this option it is possible to specify a particular keyring file the command should operate on. The default is that a command is executed
           on the trusted.gpg file as well as on all parts in the trusted.gpg.d directory, though trusted.gpg is the primary keyring which means that
           e.g. new keys are added to this one.

FFIILLEESS
       /etc/apt/trusted.gpg
           Keyring of local trusted keys, new keys will be added here. Configuration Item: Dir::Etc::Trusted.

       /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/
           File fragments for the trusted keys, additional keyrings can be stored here (by other packages or the administrator). Configuration Item
           Dir::Etc::TrustedParts.

       /etc/apt/trustdb.gpg
           Local trust database of archive keys.

       /usr/share/keyrings/ubuntu-archive-keyring.gpg
           Keyring of Ubuntu archive trusted keys.

       /usr/share/keyrings/ubuntu-archive-removed-keys.gpg
           Keyring of Ubuntu archive removed trusted keys.
